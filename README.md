**Privacy Policy**  
## Overview  
This Privacy Policy explains what data the Semuta Casino Bot (“Bot”) collects, how it is used, and your choices. By using the Bot, you consent to this policy.

## Data We Collect  
- Discord identifiers: user IDs, guild IDs, channel IDs, role IDs.  
- Game data: balances, wagers, wins/losses, session histories.  
- Configuration settings: slash-command options, admin role lists, request channel IDs.  
- Operational logs: error reports, command execution details, timestamps.  
- Optional API usage: if you enable the external API, request payloads and metadata are recorded for auditing.

## How We Use Data  
- Provide and operate in-game features, leaderboards, and request workflows.  
- Enforce gameplay limits and prevent abuse (e.g., rate limiting, moderation actions).  
- Diagnose issues, improve reliability, and monitor service health.  
- Respond to support inquiries and verify account ownership.

## Data Sharing  
- We do not sell or rent your data.  
- Data may be shared with infrastructure providers (e.g., hosting, database, logging services) strictly to operate the Bot.  
- We may disclose data if required by law, Discord policy enforcement, or to protect rights and safety.

## Retention  
- Game balances and configuration settings persist until manually reset or the Bot is removed from the server.  
- Logs and audit trails are retained for up to 90 days unless longer retention is necessary for legal or security reasons.

## Security  
- Secrets (e.g., tokens, database credentials) are stored outside source control and protected with environment variables.  
- Databases run in restricted environments with access controls.  
- No system can be perfectly secure; report issues to the contact below.

## User Choices  
- Remove the Bot from your server to stop future data collection.  
- Contact us to request deletion of stored server data; verification that you own/manage the server may be required.  
- Members can request removal of personal data; certain records (e.g., audit logs) may be retained as required for security or legal obligations.

## Minors  
- The Bot is not directed to children under 13 (or Discord’s region-specific minimum). We do not knowingly store personal data of minors beyond what Discord already provides.

## Changes  
- Policy updates will be posted in this repository or announced via the support server. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
